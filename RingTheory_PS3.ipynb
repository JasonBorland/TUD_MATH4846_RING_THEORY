    "### 1. Brute Force\n",
    "Sometimes we can show a polynomial is irreducible simply by showing that none of the polynomials that could possibly be factors are factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show that $x^4 + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$.  Use an argument by contradiction.  If $x^4 + x + 1$ is reducible, it has a factor of degree 1 or degree 2. Use long division or other arguments to show that none of these is actually a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Checking all the possible roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a polynomial with degree 2 or higher is irreducible in $F[x]$, then it has no roots in F.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a polynomial with degree 2 or 3 is irreducible in F, then it has no roots in $F[x]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show that $f(x) = 2x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$ by showing that it has no roots.\n",

    "Possible values of $x \\ are \\  0, 1, 2$. \n",
    "$f(0) = 1$\n",
    "$f(1) = 4$\n",
    "$f(2) = 11$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So f(x) has no roots and is degree 2 so it is irreducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 3$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$.  Possible values of $x \\ are \\ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. Therefore $f(0) = 3$, $f(1) = 8$, $f(2) = 47$, $f(3) = 174$, $f(4) = 467$. So f(x) has no roots, however it is a degree 4 polynomial so we cannot conclude it is irreducible.  \n",

    "### 3. Using roots to factor.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Rational Root Theorem\n",
    "Consider the polynomial $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_0 $. With integer coefficents $a_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_0, a_n \\ne 0$. Solutions of the equation are also called roots or zeroes of the polynomial on the left side.  The theorem states that each rational solution $ x = \\frac{p}{q}$ written in lowest terms so that p and q are relatively prime, satisfies:\n",
    "1. p is an integer factor of the constant term $a_0$, and\n",
    "2. q is an integer factor of the leading coefficient $a_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our polynomial f(x), $p = \\pm1, \\pm2$ and $q = \\pm1, \\pm3$.  The possible roots are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm\\frac{1}{3},  \\pm\\frac{2}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So $f(1) = 12$, $f(-1) = 0$, $f(2) = 60$, $f(-2) = 0$, $f(\\frac{1}{3}) = 0$, $f(\\frac{-1}{3}) = \\frac{-20}{9}$, $f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{40}{9}$, $f(\\frac{-2}{3}) = \\frac{-4}{3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the polynomial $f(x) = 3x^3 + 8x^2 + 3x -2$ has factorisation $(x +1)(x+2)(x-\\frac{1}{3})$, and has roots $x=-1$, $x=-2$, and $x=\\frac{1}{3}$.  \n",

    "### 4. Eisensteins's Criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "Eisenstein’s Criterion is another method can be used to determine if a polynomial is irreducible. Note that if we can’t find a prime to make Eisenstein’s Criterion work, that does not tell us for certain that the polynomial is not irreducible.\n",

    "b. p does not divide $a_n$.\n",
    "c. $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Pick p = 5.  $p \\nmid 1$, $p \\mid 50$, and $p^2 = 25 \\nmid 1$.  THus f(x) is irreducible over Q by Eisentstein's Criterion with p=5. Could easily use p=2 as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is $f(x) = 5x^11 -6x^4 + 12x^3 +36x +6 \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick p = 2.  $p \\nmid 5$, $p \\mid -6$, $p \\mid 12$, $p \\mid 36$, $p \\mid 6$, and $p^2 = 4 \\nmid 5$.  Thus f(x) is is irreducible over Q by Eisentstein's Criterion with p=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing Mod p\n",
    "\n",
    "The final method we have learned is reducing our polynomials mod a prime . If we reduce the polynomial mod and the result is reducible, then this doesn’t tell us anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "If f(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients and p is a prime that does not divide the leading coefficient of f(x), then we can reduce the polynomial mod p.  If the reduced polynomial is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ then the original polynomial in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is irreducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is $f(x) = 5x^2 + 10x + 4$ irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$?  Pick p = 3.  $g(x) = 2x^2 + x + 1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$. So are there any roots? g(0) = 1, g(1) = 1, g(2) = 2.  There are no roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$  and the degree is 2, so the polynomial g(x) is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$, therefore f(x) is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is $f(x) = 3x^3 + 7x^2 + 10x -5$ irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$? Pick p = 2.  Therefore $g(x) = x^3 + x^2 +1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$. So are there any roots? g(0) = 1, g(1) = 1.  There are no roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$ and the degree of g is 3, so g(x) is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$, therefore f(x) is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is $f(x) = 9x^4 + 4x^3 -3x +7$ irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$?  Therefore pick p =2. Therefore $g(x) = x^4 + x + 1$.  THus f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1.  So f(x) has no roots, therefore it has no linear factors.  This means the only possible factors are quadratic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So $g(x) = x^4 + x + 1 = (x^2 + ax + 1)(x^2 + bx + 1) \\ or\\  (x^2 + ax - 1)(x^2 + bx - 1)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus $g(x) = x^4 + (a + b)x^3 + (2 + ab)x^2 + (a + b)x + 1$,  Equating terms $a+b=0$ and $2+ab=0$ and $a+b =1$.  Thus we have an inconsistant system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly with $g(x) = x^4 + (a + b)x^3 + (-2 + ab)x^2 - (a + b)x + 1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore there are no quadratic roots, and hence the g(x) is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$ and therefore f(x) is irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n"
